Once logged in, show list of classes
	+ create class if instructor
	+ join class if student (Separate pages like student_dashboard.html or instructor_dashboard.html)

	Fill information based on the token stored in localStorage


Once user clicks on class, add to storage again with currently selected class
	Fill instructor_class.html or student_class.html page with related info
	based on storage?
		Or use query parameters (?class=csci4200) etc.

	Includes lecture times / Prerecorded videos maybe
